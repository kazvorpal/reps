      <td>Schedule</td>
      <td>Schedule milestones are impacted by planned or unplanned    delays or accelerations resulting in a change to deliver committed scope    within the approved plan of record schedule.  It can drive associated    financial and scope change.  Examples:  POR changes, intra-year accelerations

    <tr>
      <td>Scope</td>
      <td>Change in scope could be incremental work, or work that    has been added to realize a new product, service, or result.     Deliverables may have changed based on new business requirements, priorities,    or needs.  Examples:     Accelerations from new fiscal year, MET activity, T-Mobile

    <tr>
      <td>Budget (Cost    Change)</td>
      <td>The program cannot    deliver to the committed scope and actual costs are exceeding the available    budget.  Additional funding is needed from Portfolio to complete the    work.  The new funding may be added or transferred in.    
         
        Conversely, the    program completes the committed scope and the costs end up being less than    the budget.  In this case, the excess funds could be returned to    Portfolio.  
         
        Examples:  unit cost change, labor rate    change, CCRB plan vs. actual plan </td>
